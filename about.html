		<h1>About</h1>
			<p> Hey everyone, I'm Kylie. Recent graduate from the University of Michigan, studying Economics, International Studies and Spanish. Consider home to be London (UK, not Ontario). I'm a perpetual traveler, whether that be within the city or across the globe. Whereever I travel, I aim to find the best cup coffee in that place (am currently writing this with cup of coffee in hand at Dollop Coffee in Chicago). </p>
			<p> I'm currently a technical marketing student at the Startup Institute, honing my skills to join a early startup come August!</p>
