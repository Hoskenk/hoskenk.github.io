		<p>Hi everyone! My name is Kylie. I recently graduated from the University of Michigan, studying Economics, International Studies and Spanish, and am looking forward to spending the summer in Chicago. I consider home to be London in the UK, but am not really 'from' anywhere. I've grown up traveling across the world; one of my recent favorites places is Thailand. I love to explore a new city by checking out the good coffee shops in the area. I also enjoying reading, knitting in the winter, and any outdoor activities!</p>
